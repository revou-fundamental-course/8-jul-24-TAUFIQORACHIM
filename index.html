                        BMI is a measurement of a person's leanness or corpulence based on their height and weight, and is intended to quantify tissue mass. 
                        It is widely used as a general indicator of whether a person has a healthy body weight for their height. 
                        Specifically, the value obtained from the calculation of BMI is used to categorize whether a person is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese depending on what range the value falls between. 
                        These ranges of BMI vary based on factors such as region and age, and are sometimes further divided into subcategories such as severely underweight or very severely obese. 
                        Being overweight or underweight can have significant health effects, so while BMI is an imperfect measure of healthy body weight, it is a useful indicator of whether any additional testing or action is required.

                            Health Evaluation: BMI provides an initial indication of a person's weight status.
                            By knowing the BMI value, a person can evaluate whether their body weight is within a healthy range according to their height.

                            ealth Prevention: Knowing BMI can help in preventing weight-related health problems,
                            such as obesity or malnutrition. This allows a person to take preventive measures or lifestyle changes if necessary.

                        <li>
                            Progress Monitoring: By monitoring changes in BMI over time,
                            a person can track progress in a weight loss or body mass increase program.  
                        </li>
    
                        <li>
                            Diet and Fitness Planning: BMI can be a guide in planning a diet and fitness program. 
                            This helps set goals that are realistic and appropriate to individual needs.

                            Medical Screening: BMI is used in medical practice as an initial screening tool for weight-related health problems,
                            such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and high blood pressure.

                            Use in Public Health: On a population scale, 
                            BMI is used to monitor public health trends related to obesity and other health problems.
